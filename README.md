🧹 Excel Data Cleaning Project

Dataset Used: (Write dataset name here, e.g., “Online Retail Sales Dataset from Kaggle”)

📌 Objective

This project demonstrates how raw real-world data can be cleaned and transformed into structured, usable, and analysis-ready format using Microsoft Excel only.

The goal was to detect errors, fix inconsistent entries, deal with missing data, remove duplicates, and improve overall data integrity.

🧪 Problems Found in the Raw Data

-Inconsistent text format (uppercase/lowercase mix)

-Extra spaces in cells

-Blank / missing values

-Duplicate entries

-Combined text fields needing separation

-Formula errors (like #N/A or #VALUE!)

-Unclear formatting, making data hard to read
